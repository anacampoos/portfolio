    <h3>The Idea</h3>

    <p>With Virtual Races you can search and run popular routes near you, competing with other users that ran the same route.</p>

    <h3>No routes near you? No problem! </h3>

    <p>A route can be generated by the app, according to your requirements and have users from all around the world competing.</p>
