<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Ana Campos and I am a junior product designer from Coimbra, Portugal. I have a bachelor's degree in Communication Design and right now I am attending a postgraduate course in Digital Experience Design at the University of Lisbon.</p>

<p>As a designer I am motivated to search for ways to create a better more sustainable world and I want my approach to design to always reflect that. I am passionate about addressing problems and creating solutions using user-centered methodologies in order to create products that impact communities in a positive way.</p>
